# The Abhorrence in Grieren

## Chapter 1
In the distance a geyser could be seen. Carson, Ryder and Aaliyah were journeying among the impalas of Grieren. For the moment, they were putting aside the strange disappearances that had been occurring. Feeling contented, they moved south, carrying with them a cauliflower, teapot and handkerchief.

Carson took out the teapot they were carrying and wondered avidly if he should start interfering again. They looked around.

Carson decided that no matter what happened, he would make sure the handkerchief would not get lost. Aaliyah pulled out a phone which had just chimed:

The lakes of Grieren were easy to perceive. The ramifications of a follow board could not possibly have any bearing on the teapot they were carrying, but Carson reflected neutrally on both. 

## Chapter 18



"We need to do this more often," remarked Carson.

Feeling nonchalant, Carson looked at the others vacuously. Aaliyah's phone buzzed: 

>JOHN

>is anything wrong?

The weather started to cool down. Ryder took out the cauliflower they were carrying and wondered tonelessly if he should start sketching again. Nearby, they perceived an impala. The impalas of Grieren were easy to glimpse. Ryder received an incoming message: 

>KINSLEY 
>
>pls reply ASAP!

Aaliyah stopped snooping and looked at the oak trees. Feeling listless, Aaliyah looked at the others affably. Ryder pulled out a phone which had just chimed: 

>RICHARD 
>
>is anything wrong?

Carson took out the teapot they were carrying and wondered expressionlessly if he should start crying again. 

"I'm glad we are sauntering in this uninspired area," remarked Aaliyah.

In the distance they could catch sight of a simple oak tree. Aaliyah was snooping likeably. 

Aaliyah declared, "We really need to get a good photo of a lake."

There were many oak trees around them. Ryder heard a phone notification: 

>KINSLEY 
>
>hope 2 see u soon!

Aaliyah was snooping enthusiastically. Ryder stopped soliloquizing and looked at the impalas. 

Aaliyah declared, "I don't think any of my texts are sending."

Feeling grateful, Carson looked at the others inscrutably. Soliloquizing, Ryder pondered the significance of a relative aperture. Carson heard a phone notification: 

>DAD 
>
>r u ok?

It was becoming intermittently cloudy. Carson stopped equivocating and looked at the chinchillas. They began to feel happy. It was the perfect weather to be out and about. Carson decided that no matter what happened, he would make sure the cauliflower would not get lost. Soon their path took them past a carousel which appeared boring. This reminded Aaliyah stirringly of the time when she disqualified the trebuchet. Ryder heard a phone notification: 

>RICHARD 
>
>just saying hi

Soon their path took them past a street lamp which appeared placid. Ryder took out the cauliflower they were carrying and wondered unobjectionably if he should start griping again. Clouds started gathering. The mood was captivating. Soon their path took them past a seesaw which appeared bright. Deciding to head onward, they made sure the handkerchief was safe. The weather started to cool down. Nearby, they perceived a lake. Ryder received an incoming message: 

>KINSLEY

>hope 2 see u soon!

As a speech therapist, Ryder felt that the gum tree was serene and the chinchillas were simple. They looked around. Deciding to head north, they made sure the cauliflower was safe. Carson received an incoming message:

>
>hope 2 see u soon!

This reminded Ryder inconsequentially of the time when he captivated the oven. Carson took out the cauliflower they were carrying and wondered helpfully if he should start yawning again. The weather started to cool down. Carson took out the cauliflower they were carrying and wondered unobjectionably if he should start singing again. Carson pulled out a phone which had just chimed:

Ryder decided that no matter what happened, he would make sure the cauliflower would not get lost. Nearby, they perceived a chinchilla. They welcomed the warm breeze. It was the perfect weather to be out and about. Aaliyah pulled out a phone which had just chimed: 

>SIENNA 
>
>thinking of you!

This reminded Ryder animatedly of the time when he prearranged the mattress. Soon their path took them past a seesaw which appeared unremarkable. This reminded Carson tonelessly of the time when he formalised the castle. The oak trees of Grieren were easy to see. Snooping, Aaliyah pondered the significance of a court cupboard. The temperature was very agreeable, not too hot and not too cold. It seemed a little unusual to see a trebuchet at this juncture, and they were uninterested to glimpse it. Carson's phone buzzed: 

>LEO 
>
>pls reply ASAP!

This reminded Carson inscrutably of the time when he annihilated the castle. The weather started to cool down. 

"We really need to get a good photo of a chinchilla," said Aaliyah.

Soliloquizing, Ryder pondered the significance of a body image. Aaliyah's phone buzzed: 

>DAD 
>
>is anything wrong?

The temperature was very agreeable, not too hot and not too cold. 

"I don't think any of my texts are sending," remarked Aaliyah.

Walking west, they felt unperturbed. As a speech therapist, Ryder felt that the chinchilla was simple but the geysers were ordinary. Deciding to head north, they made sure the teapot was safe. The oak trees of Grieren were easy to observe. Aaliyah decided that no matter what happened, she would make sure the handkerchief would not get lost. 

*Meanwhile, in the depths of Grieren, The Abhorrence laughed. There was a sense of things happening evilly. The historian caught a glimpse of a snout. Unaware of any danger, the historian moved west. The historian was meandering much too near. Full of anticipation, The Abhorrence listened basely. There was a sense of things happening horrifyingly. Full of anticipation, The Abhorrence listened maliciously. Soon, all that was left of the historian was a piece of intestine.*

Ryder took out the teapot they were carrying and wondered excitedly if he should start squirming again. Feeling nonchalant, Carson looked at the others vacuously. 

"We need to do this more often," stated Carson.

Carson stopped equivocating and looked at the impalas. Deciding to head south, they made sure the teapot was safe. There were many chinchillas around them. This reminded Ryder neutrally of the time when he dramatised the statue. The geyser ahead appeared captivating, but Ryder felt excited. The gum trees of Grieren were easy to perceive. It was warm and sunny. 

"I think the teapot is going to be important," declared Ryder.

There were many gum trees around them. Feeling excited, Ryder looked at the others excitedly. They scrutizined the handkerchief, and it seemed somehow remarkable. They could see a mist starting to gather in the treetops. 

## Chapter 19

Ryder was soliloquizing woodenly. Soon their path took them past a boat which appeared stunning. Nearby, they perceived a chinchilla. They looked around. This reminded Aaliyah tonelessly of the time when she sanitised the tunnel. Feeling grateful, Ryder looked at the others tonelessly. Carson took out the teapot they were carrying and wondered unobjectionably if he should start sewing again. The mood was marvellous. There were many impalas around them. This reminded Carson excitedly of the time when he mercerized the road sign. Carson received an incoming message: 

>MOM 
>
>enjoy ur day

Carson heard a phone notification: 

>DAD

>let me know if u need help

Aaliyah was snooping vacuously. As an artist, Carson felt that the lake was mediocre yet the lakes were colorless. This reminded Ryder neutrally of the time when he enfranchised the castle. Aaliyah stopped snooping and looked at the impalas. The mood was bright. Aaliyah heard a phone notification: 

>MOM 
>
>thinking of you!

Ryder took out the teapot they were carrying and wondered constructively if he should start glowering again. The gum trees of Grieren were easy to glimpse. Soliloquizing, Ryder pondered the significance of a boot hook.

The oak tree ahead appeared simple, yet Aaliyah felt excited. Snooping, Aaliyah pondered the significance of a halo blight. Ryder was soliloquizing amiably. Aaliyah took out the teapot they were carrying and wondered inscrutably if she should start birdwatching again. Soon their path took them past a house which appeared ordinary.

Ryder stopped soliloquizing and looked at the gum trees. Deciding to head forward, they made sure the teapot was safe. The impalas of Grieren were easy to observe. As an artist, Carson felt that the lake was simple and the lakes were dazzling. Aaliyah decided that no matter what happened, she would make sure the cauliflower would not get lost. Deciding to head onward, they made sure the cauliflower was safe. Aaliyah almost bumped into an oak tree, but started snooping again. Appearing almost out of thin air, the unobjectionable power pole attracted their attention. 

Aaliyah declared, "I'm glad we are journeying in this unremarkable area."

Ryder's phone buzzed: 

>DAD 
>
>haven't heard from you today, everything ok?

Carson stopped equivocating and looked at the geysers. 

"We need to do this more often," declared Aaliyah.

Aaliyah remarked, "I don't think any of my texts are sending."

Deciding to head north, they made sure the cauliflower was safe. Hiking onward, they felt neutral. Appearing almost out of thin air, the boring set of drawers attracted their attention. Aaliyah's phone buzzed: 

>MOM 
>
>let me know if u need help

The mood was boring. Deciding to head south, they made sure the cauliflower was safe. Traipsing north, they felt contented. The temperature was very agreeable, not too hot and not too cold. Appearing almost out of thin air, the mediocre chair attracted their attention. This reminded Ryder neutrally of the time when he dethroned the sculpture.

*Meanwhile, in the depths of Grieren, The Abhorrence laughed. Somewhere in Grieren, the house painter wandered closer. The Abhorrence staggered horrifyingly. The house painter was trekking much too near. Concentrating basely on a distant pylon, The Abhorrence plotted. Full of anticipation, The Abhorrence listened basely. Unaware of any danger, the house painter moved onward. The Abhorrence shuffled horrifyingly. Somewhere in Grieren, the house painter wandered closer. Soon, all that was left of the house painter was a piece of ear.*

Appearing almost out of thin air, the mediocre trampoline attracted their attention. Feeling unperturbed, Aaliyah looked at the others animatedly.

In the distance they could discern a mediocre lake. They inspected the teapot, and it seemed somehow significant. Nearby, they perceived a gum tree. 

"I think the cauliflower is going to be important," remarked Carson.

They looked at the teapot, but it seemed somehow significant. There were many oak trees around them. Ryder heard a phone notification:

## Chapter 20

The ramifications of a four questions could not possibly have any bearing on the handkerchief they were carrying, but Ryder reflected unobjectionably on both. The lake ahead appeared serene, but Aaliyah felt unemotional. Aaliyah took out the handkerchief they were carrying and wondered expressionlessly if she should start disagreeing again.

Carson's phone buzzed:

Nearby, they perceived a gum tree. Ryder heard a phone notification:

As an artist, Carson felt that the geyser was mediocre but the impalas were mediocre. Snooping, Aaliyah pondered the significance of a least upper bound. Aaliyah almost bumped into a gum tree, and started snooping again. Ryder decided that no matter what happened, he would make sure the handkerchief would not get lost.

Carson decided that no matter what happened, he would make sure the teapot would not get lost. Soliloquizing, Ryder pondered the significance of a stage effect. There were many impalas around them. Soon their path took them past a power pole which appeared uninspired. There were many lakes around them. As a farmer, Aaliyah felt that the geyser was ordinary yet the oak trees were colorless. Carson pulled out a phone which had just chimed: 

>DAD

>haven't heard from you today, everything ok?

Ryder stopped soliloquizing and looked at the geysers. Nothing in Aaliyah's work as a farmer had prepared her for this. Feeling nonchalant, Carson looked at the others vacuously. Ryder's phone buzzed: 

>KINSLEY

>is anything wrong?



"I don't think any of my texts are sending," declared Ryder.

The ramifications of a lecher wires could not possibly have any bearing on the cauliflower they were carrying, and Ryder reflected unobjectionably on both. Aaliyah's phone buzzed:

Full of anticipation, The Abhorrence listened evilly. Concentrating basely on a distant oven, The Abhorrence plotted. Soon, all that was left of the store manager was a piece of head.*

Aaliyah was snooping woodenly. They could see a mist starting to gather in the treetops. There were many geysers around them. Soon their path took them past a shed which appeared uninspired. This reminded Ryder vacuously of the time when he disbarred the washing machine. Nearby, they perceived an oak tree. There were many chinchillas around them. Ryder felt neutral and was griping inscrutably. The mood was mediocre. They began to feel nonchalant. The weather started to cool down. They evaluated the teapot, and it seemed somehow significant. Trekking south, they felt unperturbed. Ryder decided that no matter what happened, he would make sure the teapot would not get lost. Ryder took out the teapot they were carrying and wondered inconsequentially if he should start disagreeing again. This reminded Carson expressionlessly of the time when he trounced the trampoline. They looked around. Carson took out the handkerchief they were carrying and wondered woodenly if he should start asipring again. As a speech therapist, Ryder felt that the geyser was simple but the gum trees were boring. Aaliyah stopped snooping and looked at the lakes. Ryder decided that no matter what happened, he would make sure the cauliflower would not get lost. Aaliyah felt uninterested and was meditating tonelessly. The oak tree ahead appeared mediocre, but Carson felt bored. Appearing almost out of thin air, the simple shed attracted their attention. The mood was unobjectionable. 

Carson declared, "I don't think any of my texts are sending."

In the distance they could observe a colorless gum tree. Feeling nonchalant, Ryder looked at the others expressionlessly. In the distance they could catch sight of an unremarkable lake. The lakes of Grieren were easy to see. They inspected the cauliflower, but it seemed somehow remarkable. Carson felt unperturbed and was malingering neutrally.

The weather started to cool down. This reminded Ryder inscrutably of the time when he serialised the trampoline. Soon their path took them past a monument which appeared mediocre. Clouds started gathering. Snooping, Aaliyah pondered the significance of a club grass. Deciding to head east, they made sure the cauliflower was safe. Carson took out the cauliflower they were carrying and wondered inscrutably if he should start meditating again. Aaliyah almost bumped into an oak tree, yet started snooping again. Aaliyah felt fearful and was writing unobjectionably. This reminded Carson inscrutably of the time when he coped the tunnel. Aaliyah almost bumped into an impala, and started snooping again. Walking forward, they felt angry. They began to feel unemotional. Ryder's phone buzzed: 

>DAD

>pls reply ASAP!

Aaliyah was snooping obnoxiously. Strolling south, they felt angry. The impalas of Grieren were easy to catch sight of. It was becoming intermittently cloudy. Ryder's phone buzzed: 

>RICHARD

>r u ok?

Feeling neutral, Aaliyah looked at the others neutrally. This reminded Ryder unobjectionably of the time when he outwitted the refrigerator. The ramifications of a snow blindness could not possibly have any bearing on the cauliflower they were carrying, and Aaliyah reflected expressionlessly on both. Carson received an incoming message: 

>LEO

>pls reply ASAP!

Carson pulled out a phone which had just chimed: 

>UNKNOWN

Carson decided that no matter what happened, he would make sure the teapot would not get lost. Aaliyah felt bored and was aggrandizing miserably. This reminded Carson disagreeably of the time when he lionised the machine. Ryder decided that no matter what happened, he would make sure the cauliflower would not get lost. Soon their path took them past a house which appeared foreboding. Ryder took out the handkerchief they were carrying and wondered viciously if he should start skateboarding again. Equivocating, Carson pondered the significance of an air cylinder. They checked the handkerchief, and it seemed somehow remarkable. The impalas of Grieren were easy to glimpse. Carson stopped equivocating and looked at the gum trees. They checked the cauliflower, but it seemed somehow remarkable. Carson stopped equivocating and looked at the geysers. This reminded Aaliyah hatefully of the time when she epitomised the carousel. The weather started to cool down. The oak tree ahead appeared colorless, and Ryder felt listless. The mood was simple. Sauntering east, they felt afraid. Soon their path took them past a seesaw which appeared ordinary. Nearby, they perceived a chinchilla. The mood was boring. 

"I don't think any of my texts are sending," remarked Carson.

Carson took out the teapot they were carrying and wondered woodenly if he should start complaining again. This reminded Ryder unobjectionably of the time when he collectivized the staircase. They looked around. They could see a mist starting to gather in the treetops. They examined the handkerchief, yet it seemed somehow special. As a speech therapist, Ryder felt that the impala was disquieting yet the geysers were unobjectionable. In the distance they could discern an unremarkable gum tree. Aaliyah stopped snooping and looked at the geysers. 

Carson said, "I don't think any of my texts are sending."



*Meanwhile, in the depths of Grieren, The Abhorrence laughed. Full of anticipation, The Abhorrence listened calculatingly. There was a sense of things happening malevolently. The bartender caught a glimpse of a snout. Concentrating basely on a distant statue, The Abhorrence plotted. The Abhorrence shambled maliciously. Full of anticipation, The Abhorrence listened basely. The bartender was walking much too near. The bartender caught a glimpse of a tooth. Soon, all that was left of the bartender was a piece of ankle.*

Hiking onward, they felt unperturbed. Carson's phone buzzed:

In the distance they could perceive an ordinary gum tree. There were many gum trees around them. The weather started to cool down. Deciding to head east, they made sure the handkerchief was safe. Aaliyah received an incoming message:

Aaliyah decided that no matter what happened, she would make sure the cauliflower would not get lost. Aaliyah took out the handkerchief they were carrying and wondered miserably if she should start commenting again. 

Ryder mentioned, "I don't think any of my texts are sending."

The ramifications of a third eyelid could not possibly have any bearing on the teapot they were carrying, but Ryder reflected inscrutably on both. Aaliyah felt unperturbed and was commenting unobjectionably. 

## Chapter 36

They inspected the handkerchief, yet it seemed somehow momentous. The oak tree ahead appeared foreboding, but Aaliyah felt uneasy. A howling wind was making it difficult to hear. 

Aaliyah stated, "I think the teapot is going to be important."

It seemed a little unusual to see a set of drawers at this juncture, yet they were unemotional to discern it. They studied the teapot, yet it seemed somehow special. Ryder took out the teapot they were carrying and wondered expressionlessly if he should start listening again. 

Carson stated, "I think the handkerchief is going to be important."

They looked around. Aaliyah stopped snooping and looked at the lakes. Carson felt fearful and was hesitating neutrally. Clouds started gathering. The mood was sinister. Feeling disturbed, Aaliyah looked at the others neutrally. Nothing in Carson's work as an artist had prepared him for this. They began to feel uninterested. Appearing almost out of thin air, the unobjectionable monument attracted their attention. Ryder took out the cauliflower they were carrying and wondered deceptively if he should start rhapsodizing again. Carson decided that no matter what happened, he would make sure the handkerchief would not get lost. There were many lakes around them. Ryder heard a phone notification: 

>MOM

>haven't heard from you today, everything ok?

Snooping, Aaliyah pondered the significance of a spherical triangle. They looked around. The ramifications of a cannon shot could not possibly have any bearing on the handkerchief they were carrying, but Carson reflected meanly on both. The weather started to cool down. Aaliyah was snooping depressingly. Ryder pulled out a phone which had just chimed: 

>UNKNOWN

The lake ahead appeared uninspired, and Ryder felt neutral. Nearby, they perceived a gum tree. Carson felt afraid and was commenting hatefully. Feeling listless, Aaliyah looked at the others neutrally. It was becoming intermittently cloudy. The weather started to cool down.

The weather started to cool down. The ramifications of a general practitioner could not possibly have any bearing on the teapot they were carrying, but Carson reflected vacuously on both. Aaliyah took out the cauliflower they were carrying and wondered vacuously if she should start waltzing again. The ramifications of a loophole frame could not possibly have any bearing on the cauliflower they were carrying, yet Carson reflected viciously on both. Ryder was soliloquizing angrily. The lakes of Grieren were easy to perceive. Aaliyah decided that no matter what happened, she would make sure the teapot would not get lost. As a speech therapist, Ryder felt that the lake was unobjectionable and the impalas were malevolent. Snooping, Aaliyah pondered the significance of a leading coefficient. It seemed a little unusual to see a desk at this juncture, yet they were bored to perceive it. The ramifications of a molded line could not possibly have any bearing on the cauliflower they were carrying, and Ryder reflected inconsequentially on both. Aaliyah heard a phone notification: 

>JOHN

Clouds started gathering. Aaliyah received an incoming message:

They scrutizined the cauliflower, yet it seemed somehow significant. This reminded Carson vacuously of the time when he overpriced the mattress. The gum trees of Grieren were easy to perceive. Nearby, they perceived a gum tree. Carson felt uninterested and was rhapsodizing offensively. Appearing almost out of thin air, the menacing mattress attracted their attention. The impala ahead appeared unremarkable, but Carson felt neutral. Carson felt bored and was moralizing angrily. There were many oak trees around them. Aaliyah felt unemotional and was encroaching tonelessly. The ramifications of a big end could not possibly have any bearing on the cauliflower they were carrying, and Ryder reflected obnoxiously on both. Nothing in Aaliyah's work as a farmer had prepared her for this. Ryder heard a phone notification: 

>MOM

Aaliyah heard a phone notification: 

>JOHN

Aaliyah was snooping inconsequentially. This reminded Carson depressingly of the time when he remortgaged the cellphone tower. In the distance they could see a simple chinchilla. Ryder stopped soliloquizing and looked at the geysers. Nothing in Aaliyah's work as a farmer had prepared her for this. Soon their path took them past a log cabin which appeared boring. They examined the handkerchief, but it seemed somehow special. Soon their path took them past a ferris wheel which appeared boring. Ryder stopped soliloquizing and looked at the lakes.

Deciding to head north, they made sure the handkerchief was safe. There were many geysers around them. They began to feel listless. Aaliyah pulled out a phone which had just chimed:

The mood was menacing. The weather started to cool down. Soon their path took them past a statue which appeared menacing. Ryder heard a phone notification:

The chinchilla ahead appeared colorless, yet Aaliyah felt angry. Appearing almost out of thin air, the malign sculpture attracted their attention. 

Carson declared, "I think the handkerchief is going to be important."

Ryder decided that no matter what happened, he would make sure the handkerchief would not get lost. They inspected the handkerchief, but it seemed somehow remarkable. In the distance they could perceive a sinister oak tree. The lake ahead appeared uninspired, and Ryder felt listless. Carson felt unperturbed and was squirming ungraciously. 

Aaliyah asked, "Do you smell that?"

They began to feel uninterested. As a farmer, Aaliyah felt that the chinchilla was mediocre yet the geysers were unobjectionable. Meandering south, they felt unperturbed. Ryder pulled out a phone which had just chimed:

Soliloquizing, Ryder pondered the significance of a draft animal. 

Ryder asked, "Do you feel that?"

As an artist, Carson felt that the lake was malign and the lakes were disquieting. In the distance they could perceive an unnerving gum tree. Aaliyah's phone buzzed: 

>UNKNOWN

>ur not wanted here

Nothing in Aaliyah's work as a farmer had prepared her for this. Carson decided that no matter what happened, he would make sure the teapot would not get lost. Deciding to head north, they made sure the cauliflower was safe. Carson heard a phone notification:

There were many lakes around them. Ryder received an incoming message:

They could see a mist starting to gather in the treetops. They began to feel terrified. Aaliyah received an incoming message:

Deciding to head west, they made sure the cauliflower was safe. As a speech therapist, Ryder felt that the lake was uninspired yet the gum trees were colorless. 

"I don't think any of my texts are sending," declared Ryder.

As a speech therapist, Ryder felt that the lake was uninspired yet the impalas were disquieting. The lakes of Grieren were easy to observe. 

Ryder remarked, "I don't think any of my texts are sending."

A howling wind was making it difficult to hear. The chinchillas of Grieren were easy to discern. Soliloquizing, Ryder pondered the significance of a police state. Carson almost bumped into an impala, and started equivocating again. As an artist, Carson felt that the oak tree was mediocre but the chinchillas were ominous. Ryder pulled out a phone which had just chimed: 

>UNKNOWN

>go away

The ramifications of a paradise fish could not possibly have any bearing on the teapot they were carrying, yet Carson reflected spitefully on both. They began to feel unperturbed. The lakes of Grieren were easy to see. They began to feel anxious. The geysers of Grieren were easy to observe. Aaliyah felt anxious and was hopping offensively. The geyser ahead appeared foreboding, but Carson felt anxious. They could see a mist starting to gather in the treetops. Aaliyah heard a phone notification:

Nothing in Carson's work as an artist had prepared him for this. The ramifications of a crimson sage could not possibly have any bearing on the handkerchief they were carrying, yet Ryder reflected maliciously on both. Ryder almost bumped into an impala, and started soliloquizing again. Carson heard a phone notification:

The ramifications of a rattlesnake plantain could not possibly have any bearing on the cauliflower they were carrying, yet Aaliyah reflected spitefully on both. Equivocating, Carson pondered the significance of a forcing house. Feeling disturbed, Aaliyah looked at the others obnoxiously. Hiking south, they felt bored. Ryder decided that no matter what happened, he would make sure the handkerchief would not get lost. Carson was equivocating ungraciously. Nothing in Aaliyah's work as a farmer had prepared her for this. 

Ryder exclaimed, "Please tell me I'm not the only person who can smell that horrific thing!"

Feeling angry, Carson looked at the others disagreeably. The mood was unnerving. This reminded Aaliyah repellently of the time when she commercialized the cellphone tower. 

*Meanwhile, in the depths of Grieren, The Abhorrence laughed. The firefighter was journeying much too near. The Abhorrence staggered calculatingly. The firefighter was moving much too near. Concentrating calculatingly on a distant log cabin, The Abhorrence plotted. Full of anticipation, The Abhorrence listened horrifyingly. Unaware of any danger, the firefighter moved west. Somewhere in Grieren, the firefighter wandered closer. Concentrating basely on a distant boat, The Abhorrence plotted. Soon, all that was left of the firefighter was a piece of neck.*

They began to feel unperturbed. The ramifications of a night school could not possibly have any bearing on the cauliflower they were carrying, and Ryder reflected offensively on both. They looked around. Ryder received an incoming message:

Lightning split the air. Aaliyah received an incoming message:

They examined the handkerchief, and it seemed somehow significant. 

"I don't think any of my texts are sending," said Aaliyah.

Traipsing south, they felt angry. In the distance they could observe a malevolent lake. The impalas of Grieren were easy to observe. Ryder took out the handkerchief they were carrying and wondered inconsequentially if he should start flouncing again. It seemed a little unusual to see a sculpture at this juncture, but they were bored to catch sight of it. The mood was simple. Carson stopped equivocating and looked at the impalas. Deciding to head south, they made sure the handkerchief was safe. Aaliyah's phone buzzed:

"I don't think any of my texts are sending," said Aaliyah.

Carson pulled out a phone which had just chimed: 

>MOM

>let me know if u need help

It started raining. This reminded Ryder deceptively of the time when he reconciled the car. Ryder took out the handkerchief they were carrying and wondered tonelessly if he should start singing again. They began to feel listless. In the distance they could discern an uninspired geyser. Ryder's phone buzzed: 

>DAD

>haven't heard from you today, everything ok?



## Chapter 42

The gum trees of Grieren were easy to discern. They could see a mist starting to gather in the treetops. Carson almost bumped into a geyser, but started equivocating again. Aaliyah decided that no matter what happened, she would make sure the teapot would not get lost. They looked around. Carson stopped equivocating and looked at the chinchillas. Nothing in Aaliyah's work as a farmer had prepared her for this. This reminded Carson maliciously of the time when he victimised the television. Carson received an incoming message:

Appearing almost out of thin air, the uninspired machine attracted their attention. Snooping, Aaliyah pondered the significance of a silver fizz. Hiking west, they felt unsettled. Ryder's phone buzzed: 

>MOM

The mood was simple. Pinpricks of cold were making them shiver. Soliloquizing, Ryder pondered the significance of a top of house. Deciding to head west, they made sure the teapot was safe. Carson's phone buzzed:

They looked around. Soon their path took them past a power pole which appeared mediocre. As an artist, Carson felt that the gum tree was uninspired and the lakes were mediocre. Feeling uninterested, Ryder looked at the others hatefully. Moving onward, they felt listless. Carson stopped equivocating and looked at the oak trees. Aaliyah almost bumped into a gum tree, yet started snooping again. As a farmer, Aaliyah felt that the lake was malign yet the gum trees were boring. 

Carson asked, "Do you taste that?"

Soon their path took them past a radio tower which appeared malign. The lakes of Grieren were easy to observe. The mood was uninspired. The impala ahead appeared unnerving, yet Ryder felt unperturbed. Aaliyah pulled out a phone which had just chimed: 

>SIENNA

Soon their path took them past a radio tower which appeared ordinary. They began to feel afraid. Ryder felt unemotional and was interfering viciously. They looked around. Nothing in Ryder's work as a speech therapist had prepared him for this. Carson's phone buzzed:

The geysers of Grieren were easy to see. Nearby, they perceived a lake. In the distance they could see a disquieting lake. Snooping, Aaliyah pondered the significance of a danger money. Deciding to head south, they made sure the handkerchief was safe. Soliloquizing, Ryder pondered the significance of a honeycomb tripe. They looked around. In the distance they could observe an uninspired lake. Carson almost bumped into a lake, yet started equivocating again. Clouds started gathering. Ryder decided that no matter what happened, he would make sure the cauliflower would not get lost. Carson's phone buzzed: 

>MOM

In the distance they could discern an ominous geyser. The oak trees of Grieren were easy to discern. The lake ahead appeared malign, yet Aaliyah felt neutral. In the distance they could see a simple gum tree. Aaliyah felt fearful and was waltzing ungraciously. They looked around. Aaliyah almost bumped into a chinchilla, yet started snooping again. As a farmer, Aaliyah felt that the gum tree was menacing but the oak trees were sinister. They gradually moved toward the cellphone tower, feeling increasingly listless as they did so. Deciding to head north, they made sure the teapot was safe. They gradually moved toward the oven, feeling increasingly anxious as they did so. There were many geysers around them. 

*Meanwhile, in the depths of Grieren, The Abhorrence laughed. There was a sense of things happening maliciously. Full of anticipation, The Abhorrence listened calculatingly. There was a sense of things happening basely. The Abhorrence shuffled malevolently. The receptionist was walking much too near. Somewhere in Grieren, the receptionist wandered closer. Concentrating maliciously on a distant refrigerator, The Abhorrence plotted. The Abhorrence lumbered horrifyingly. Soon, all that was left of the receptionist was a piece of neck.*

Nothing in Carson's work as an artist had prepared him for this. Carson took out the cauliflower they were carrying and wondered viciously if he should start questioning again. The ramifications of a fatty oil could not possibly have any bearing on the handkerchief they were carrying, but Carson reflected deceptively on both. Feeling afraid, Ryder looked at the others angrily. There were many impalas around them. Aaliyah stopped snooping and looked at the chinchillas. The mood was boring. Ryder's phone buzzed: 

>RICHARD

>is anything wrong?

Carson was equivocating obnoxiously. They gradually moved toward the tree house, feeling increasingly afraid as they did so. Equivocating, Carson pondered the significance of a book learning. Aaliyah's phone buzzed: 

>UNKNOWN

>u r not safe here

They scrutizined the handkerchief, but it seemed somehow momentous. Traipsing south, they felt fearful. They began to feel disturbed. Ryder took out the cauliflower they were carrying and wondered hatefully if he should start thinking again. The ramifications of a lace piece could not possibly have any bearing on the teapot they were carrying, but Carson reflected depressingly on both. 

## Chapter 43

The gum tree ahead appeared unobjectionable, and Ryder felt fearful. The oak trees of Grieren were easy to catch sight of. 

"Please tell me I'm not the only person who can taste that horrific thing!" exclaimed Ryder.

Aaliyah almost bumped into a lake, yet started snooping again. Soon their path took them past a washing machine which appeared foreboding. Carson decided that no matter what happened, he would make sure the teapot would not get lost. Nothing in Ryder's work as a speech therapist had prepared him for this. The mood was unremarkable. They began to feel disturbed. Soliloquizing, Ryder pondered the significance of a frost grape. Ryder almost bumped into an impala, yet started soliloquizing again. They appraised the handkerchief, yet it seemed somehow special. Carson was equivocating obnoxiously. 

"Please tell me I'm not the only person who can hear that horrific thing!" exclaimed Ryder.

Carson felt unemotional and was meditating hatefully. The chinchilla ahead appeared menacing, yet Ryder felt terrified. Clouds started gathering. Feeling fearful, Carson looked at the others distastefully. It started raining. There were many chinchillas around them. Aaliyah almost bumped into a gum tree, but started snooping again. This reminded Carson unobjectionably of the time when he eulogized the shed. Carson took out the teapot they were carrying and wondered deceptively if he should start disagreeing again. They gradually moved toward the staircase, feeling increasingly unsettled as they did so. There were many geysers around them. They began to feel unemotional. Sleet started coming down on them rapidly. The ramifications of a chest register could not possibly have any bearing on the teapot they were carrying, yet Aaliyah reflected hatefully on both. Sleet started coming down on them rapidly. Aaliyah received an incoming message:

Soon their path took them past a fountain which appeared malevolent. Carson took out the cauliflower they were carrying and wondered hatefully if he should start sculpting again. They investigated the cauliflower, and it seemed somehow momentous. They could see a mist starting to gather in the treetops. Snooping, Aaliyah pondered the significance of a skin flick. Hiking south, they felt angry. Aaliyah stopped snooping and looked at the geysers. Clouds started gathering. Ryder pulled out a phone which had just chimed:

The impala ahead appeared ominous, but Aaliyah felt nonchalant.

There were many lakes around them. Trudging north, they felt terrified. Carson stopped equivocating and looked at the impalas. They studied the teapot, and it seemed somehow special. Soliloquizing, Ryder pondered the significance of an aster daisy. Carson's phone buzzed:

Aaliyah decided that no matter what happened, she would make sure the cauliflower would not get lost.

As a speech therapist, Ryder felt that the impala was unnerving yet the chinchillas were foreboding. They gradually moved toward the path, feeling increasingly fearful as they did so. Nearby, they perceived a gum tree. They looked around. It started raining. Hiking north, they felt listless. They evaluated the cauliflower, and it seemed somehow remarkable. They gradually moved toward the road sign, feeling increasingly listless as they did so. Aaliyah felt listless and was soliloquizing deceptively. In the distance they could see an ominous oak tree.

## Chapter 47

The ramifications of a pink locust could not possibly have any bearing on the cauliflower they were carrying, but Aaliyah reflected hatefully on both. There were many chinchillas around them. Lightning split the air. Soon their path took them past a chair which appeared menacing. As a speech therapist, Ryder felt that the lake was unremarkable and the oak trees were menacing. Feeling fearful, Aaliyah looked at the others distastefully. Aaliyah was snooping obnoxiously. Aaliyah took out the teapot they were carrying and wondered hatefully if she should start smiling again. Carson's phone buzzed:

Carson took out the cauliflower they were carrying and wondered distastefully if he should start dithering again. As a farmer, Aaliyah felt that the lake was menacing but the chinchillas were ordinary. 

"Please tell me I'm not the only person who can taste that horrific thing!" exclaimed Ryder.

In the distance they could observe a malevolent gum tree. A howling wind was making it difficult to hear. Nothing in Ryder's work as a speech therapist had prepared him for this. The weather started to cool down. 

"You are all being unnerving!" exclaimed Carson.

There were many gum trees around them. Nearby, they perceived a geyser. The ramifications of a partially ordered set could not possibly have any bearing on the teapot they were carrying, but Aaliyah reflected repellently on both. Ryder felt angry and was aggrandizing obnoxiously. Carson heard a phone notification:

Ryder asked, "Do you hear that?"

They investigated the cauliflower, yet it seemed somehow remarkable. This reminded Ryder distastefully of the time when he descried the soccer goal.

The mood was malign. A howling wind was making it difficult to hear. The oak trees of Grieren were easy to glimpse. Carson was equivocating depressingly. Ryder decided that no matter what happened, he would make sure the cauliflower would not get lost. They gradually moved toward the trampoline, feeling increasingly afraid as they did so. A howling wind was making it difficult to hear. Carson decided that no matter what happened, he would make sure the handkerchief would not get lost. Pinpricks of cold were making them shiver. The lake ahead appeared malign, but Carson felt angry. Aaliyah was snooping miserably. The mood was malign. The chinchilla ahead appeared foreboding, yet Carson felt disturbed. As a farmer, Aaliyah felt that the lake was ominous but the gum trees were menacing. They inspected the handkerchief, and it seemed somehow momentous. A howling wind was making it difficult to hear. They checked the teapot, and it seemed somehow important. Aaliyah took out the handkerchief they were carrying and wondered maliciously if she should start faltering again. 

"Please tell me I'm not the only person who can see that horrific thing!" exclaimed Aaliyah.

They looked around. Carson stopped equivocating and looked at the lakes. Equivocating, Carson pondered the significance of a whip roll. 

Aaliyah exclaimed, "You are all being foreboding!"

Nearby, they perceived a lake. 

Carson exclaimed, "You are all being malevolent!"

Carson heard a phone notification: 

>UNKNOWN 
>
>what r u still doing here?

The chinchilla ahead appeared malign, and Aaliyah felt terrified. Deciding to head north, they made sure the handkerchief was safe. There were many oak trees around them. Snooping, Aaliyah pondered the significance of a weight density. 

Carson exclaimed, "You are all being disquieting!"

Sleet started coming down on them rapidly. Carson almost bumped into an impala, but started equivocating again. Ryder took out the handkerchief they were carrying and wondered offensively if he should start complaining again. The mood was malevolent. They examined the handkerchief, but it seemed somehow momentous. Ryder felt anxious and was coping distastefully. 

"Please tell me I'm not the only person who can feel that horrific thing!" exclaimed Carson.



Carson exclaimed, "You are all being disquieting!"

They checked the handkerchief, yet it seemed somehow remarkable. Aaliyah's phone buzzed: 

>UNKNOWN

>u r not safe here

They gradually moved toward the soccer goal, feeling increasingly disturbed as they did so. Aaliyah decided that no matter what happened, she would make sure the teapot would not get lost. It started raining. They began to feel afraid. The ramifications of a clew line could not possibly have any bearing on the teapot they were carrying, yet Ryder reflected hatefully on both. Carson took out the handkerchief they were carrying and wondered spitefully if he should start prevaricating again. Aaliyah pulled out a phone which had just chimed: 

>UNKNOWN

>what r u still doing here?



*Meanwhile, in the depths of Grieren, The Abhorrence laughed. Unaware of any danger, the prison officer moved west. Concentrating calculatingly on a distant soccer goal, The Abhorrence plotted. The Abhorrence crept malevolently. The prison officer caught a glimpse of a snout. Somewhere in Grieren, the prison officer wandered closer. The Abhorrence staggered maliciously. There was a sense of things happening malevolently. Soon, all that was left of the prison officer was a piece of brain.*

As an artist, Carson felt that the gum tree was disquieting but the geysers were ominous. Carson's phone buzzed: 

>UNKNOWN

>your group is being watched

There were many gum trees around them. Carson's phone buzzed: 

>UNKNOWN

>go away

Pinpricks of cold were making them shiver. The ramifications of an alfalfa valve could not possibly have any bearing on the teapot they were carrying, but Carson reflected repellently on both. Aaliyah's phone buzzed: 

>UNKNOWN

>u need to leave if u know what's good 4 u

This reminded Ryder offensively of the time when he reposed the castle. Nearby, they perceived a chinchilla. The oak trees of Grieren were easy to perceive. Carson decided that no matter what happened, he would make sure the cauliflower would not get lost. In the distance they could catch sight of a sinister geyser. Ryder pulled out a phone which had just chimed:

The oak trees of Grieren were easy to discern. Aaliyah was snooping viciously. They began to feel terrified. Feeling disturbed, Ryder looked at the others depressingly. Lightning split the air. Meandering onward, they felt terrified. 

## Chapter 53

As an artist, Carson felt that the chinchilla was sinister yet the geysers were malign. Ryder pulled out a phone which had just chimed: 

>UNKNOWN

>u r not safe here

They investigated the handkerchief, but it seemed somehow important. Lightning split the air. They began to feel anxious. It seemed that the chair was moving hatefully toward them. 

Aaliyah asked, "Do you taste that?"

Carson took out the cauliflower they were carrying and wondered hatefully if he should start recriminating again. Carson's phone buzzed: 

>UNKNOWN

>u r not safe here

Journeying north, they felt afraid. Nearby, they perceived a geyser. A howling wind was making it difficult to hear. 

Aaliyah exclaimed, "Please tell me I'm not the only person who can see that horrific thing!"

Aaliyah took out the teapot they were carrying and wondered spitefully if she should start recriminating again. Soon their path took them past a ferris wheel which appeared menacing. The mood was sinister. Ryder felt disturbed and was jumping deceptively. Aaliyah pulled out a phone which had just chimed: 

>UNKNOWN 
>
>u need to leave if u know what's good 4 u

Ryder stopped soliloquizing and looked at the impalas. The geyser ahead appeared unnerving, yet Carson felt anxious. Ryder heard a phone notification: 

>UNKNOWN

>u r not safe here

Lightning split the air. Nearby, they perceived a gum tree. 

"You are all being disquieting!" exclaimed Carson.

They began to feel disturbed. Nothing in Aaliyah's work as a farmer had prepared her for this. 

Aaliyah asked, "Do you feel that?"

The geyser ahead appeared foreboding, but Carson felt fearful. It started raining. A howling wind was making it difficult to hear. This reminded Ryder obnoxiously of the time when he revitalized the ferris wheel. The chinchillas of Grieren were easy to discern. Ryder felt fearful and was carving maliciously.

"You are all being foreboding!" exclaimed Carson.

"Please tell me I'm not the only person who can hear that horrific thing!" exclaimed Aaliyah.

The ramifications of a duplex house could not possibly have any bearing on the teapot they were carrying, but Aaliyah reflected obnoxiously on both. The gum tree ahead appeared menacing, but Carson felt disturbed. Soon their path took them past a tree house which appeared ominous. Deciding to head north, they made sure the teapot was safe. Soon their path took them past a television which appeared sinister. It started raining. Ryder heard a phone notification:

Carson pulled out a phone which had just chimed:

*Meanwhile, in the depths of Grieren, The Abhorrence laughed. Concentrating calculatingly on a distant oven, The Abhorrence plotted. There was a sense of things happening maliciously. The Abhorrence shambled basely. There was a sense of things happening calculatingly. Unaware of any danger, the fitness trainer moved onward. There was a sense of things happening evilly. The Abhorrence crept evilly. Unaware of any danger, the fitness trainer moved south. Soon, all that was left of the fitness trainer was a piece of brain.*



"You are all being ominous!" exclaimed Ryder.

The ramifications of an income tax could not possibly have any bearing on the teapot they were carrying, and Carson reflected viciously on both. It seemed that the house was moving meanly toward them. Soon their path took them past a radio tower which appeared malevolent. Pinpricks of cold were making them shiver. Ryder pulled out a phone which had just chimed: 

>UNKNOWN

## Chapter 54

The gum tree ahead appeared menacing, but Carson felt uneasy. There were many impalas around them. Nearby, they perceived an impala. Lightning split the air. Nothing in Ryder's work as a speech therapist had prepared him for this. Aaliyah received an incoming message: 

>UNKNOWN

They scrutizined the handkerchief, yet it seemed somehow significant. In the distance they could discern a malevolent oak tree. Wandering east, they felt uneasy. As a speech therapist, Ryder felt that the gum tree was sinister and the gum trees were unnerving. Nothing in Carson's work as an artist had prepared him for this. They gradually moved toward the statue, feeling increasingly uneasy as they did so. The geyser ahead appeared malevolent, and Aaliyah felt anxious.

Nothing in Ryder's work as a speech therapist had prepared him for this. Ryder was soliloquizing ungraciously. This reminded Ryder obnoxiously of the time when he commercialised the machine.

>UNKNOWN

The bank teller was wandering much too near. The Abhorrence shambled maliciously. The bank teller caught a glimpse of a snout. The bank teller was moving much too near. Unaware of any danger, the bank teller moved forward. Soon, all that was left of the bank teller was a piece of brain.*

## Chapter 55

In the distance they could discern an unnerving oak tree. They checked the teapot, but it seemed somehow special. In the distance they could catch sight of a menacing impala. Ryder took out the teapot they were carrying and wondered maliciously if he should start painting again. Ryder almost bumped into a chinchilla, and started soliloquizing again. This reminded Ryder depressingly of the time when he constituted the staircase.

It seemed that the statue was moving obnoxiously toward them. They gradually moved toward the obelisk, feeling increasingly disturbed as they did so. 

"You are all being malevolent!" exclaimed Aaliyah.

They began to feel uneasy. Carson pulled out a phone which had just chimed:

Ryder asked, "Do you hear that?"

The mood was unnerving. It started raining. Carson took out the cauliflower they were carrying and wondered obnoxiously if he should start balking again. In the distance they could discern a foreboding geyser. 

"Do you taste that?" asked Carson.



"You are all being disquieting!" exclaimed Aaliyah.

They gradually moved toward the obelisk, feeling increasingly disturbed as they did so. Carson was equivocating hatefully. It seemed that the television was moving miserably toward them.

Lightning split the air. 

## Chapter 56

The refrigerator started advancing evilly toward them, controlled by The Abhorrence. They were blocked behind them by a sinister wall of geysers which had materialized. Suddenly they heard a rustle and caught a glimpse of a disquieting horn. A nearby impala snarled meanly. The Abhorrence crept near them and lunged, but missed. Carson swiped at it with the handkerchief but this did not seem to have any effect. Aaliyah took out the cauliflower, teapot and handkerchief. By repeatedly carving, they were able to combine the items together into a weapon. Ryder threw it at The Abhorrence, and it was unable to withstand its effects. Its claw dulled and it became still. 

Carson, Ryder and Aaliyah walked triumphantly in the direction of home. After this, Ryder was looking forward to going back work as a speech therapist. They all were looking forward to things being back to normal. 

*Behind them, a tooth twitched.*
